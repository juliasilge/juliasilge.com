I love emoji `r emo::ji("heart")` and I love xkcd, so [this recent comic](https://xkcd.com/1920/) from Randall Munroe was quite a delight for me.

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/emoji_sports.png )

I sat there, enjoying the thought of these new sports like horse hole and multiplayer avocado and I thought, "I can make more of these in just the barest handful of lines of code". This is largely thanks to the [emo](https://github.com/hadley/emo) package by Hadley Wickham, which if you haven't installed and started using yet, WHY NOT??? `r emo::ji("scream")`

```{r}
emoji_sports <- function(n) {
    data <- dplyr::sample_n(emo::jis, n)
    emo::ji_glue(paste(dplyr::pull(data, emoji),
                       collapse = ""))
}
```

This function uses the `jis` dataset from the emo package, sample a few of them, and then prints them out in a R Markdown document, which is what I use to blog.  Let's make some!


## `r emoji_sports(3)`


Excellent. This new sport is a head injury formalwear competition; it's judged very strictly.

## `r emoji_sports(3)`

Here we see the new sport of being thankful for Senegalese culture.

## `r emoji_sports(3)`


This new sport is a scary one, where stars are awarded to the baby chicks with the best knife-throwing skills.


Some of the sports in the xkcd comic have only two characters, and we can make those as well.


## `r emoji_sports(2)`

Ah yes, we'll soon all be enjoying the sport of running long distances for no understandable reason. I think some of you probably *already* enjoy this sport.


Or we can generate lots with purrr.

```{r}
library(purrr)

map(sample(c(2,3), 10, replace = TRUE),
    emoji_sports)
```

Some of those emojis aren't printing quite as well, but there are definitely some winners (timed spiderweb fingerknitting and the like).

I could keep going all day, but I'll wrap it up here. `r emo::ji("wave")` Let me know if you have any questions!
