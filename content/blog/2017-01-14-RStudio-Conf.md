I spoke on approaching text mining tasks using tidy data principles at [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) yesterday. I was so happy to have the opportunity to speak and the conference has been a great experience.

If you want to catch up on what has been going on at rstudio::conf, Karl Broman put together a [GitHub repo of slides](https://github.com/kbroman/RStudioConf2017Slides) and Sharon Machlis has been [live-blogging the conference](http://www.computerworld.com/article/3157004/data-analytics/best-tips-and-takeaways-from-rstudio-conference.html) at Computerworld. A highlight for me was [Andrew Flowers'](https://twitter.com/andrewflowers) talk on data journalism and storytelling; I don't work in data journalism but I think I can apply almost everything he said to how I approach what I do.

My collaborator [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/) and I made a very exciting announcement at the conference; we are publishing our book on text mining in R using tidy data principles with O'Reilly!

The book will continue to be [available online](http://tidytextmining.com/); we are working on getting the content finished and you can expect to see the published product from O'Reilly the middle of this year. I was really pleased to have great discussions with people at rstudio::conf about how they are analyzing text and approaching natural language processing, and it was a pleasure to just connect with people in the R community in general.
